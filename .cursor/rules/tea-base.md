# Tea Base - Project Rules

## Tech Stack
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (core utilities only - no custom compilation)
- Convex for backend (database, auth, serverless functions)
- Vercel for deployment

## MLP Philosophy
- Every feature must be functional AND delightful
- Personality is not optional - it's core to viability
- Design for emotion, not just utility

## Code Style
- Functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Destructure imports: import { useState } from 'react'
- Use Tailwind utility classes (no arbitrary values unless necessary)
- Semantic HTML for accessibility
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Component Patterns
- Every interaction needs thoughtful animation/transition
- Empty states should be helpful and delightful
- Loading states should be calming (like steeping tea)
- Error states should be friendly, never cold

## Tea Content
- All tea data must include cultural context and story
- Copy should be warm, knowledgeable, approachable
- Never condescending - make users feel like enthusiasts
- Temperature/time as experiences, not just numbers

## Testing
- Test core functionality (search, filter, auth, collections)
- Test mobile responsiveness (primary use case)
- Test accessibility (keyboard nav, screen readers)

## Workflow
- Always check mobile view after UI changes
- Run typecheck before committing
- Keep commits focused and meaningful
